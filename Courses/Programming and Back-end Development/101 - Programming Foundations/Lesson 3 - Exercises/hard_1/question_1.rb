# What do you expect to happen when the greeting variable is referenced in the last line of the code below?
#
# ```
# if false
#   greeting = “hello world”
# end
#
# greeting
# ```

# false is always false and therefore the if statement will never execute
# This means that greeting will never be initialized and be set to nil.
